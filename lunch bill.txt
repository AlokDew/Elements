Occupational Therapy—It's been almost 1.5 years now. So starting with his core strength, as he had low tone, and then now shifted to the sensory integration part as per our OT's after achieving gross motor and settling down most of the sensory parts.



Speech Therapy—It has also been almost 1 yr now; we're having a session once or twice in the month. There they assess and give a plan to work at home. So currently we're working on his tongue, cheek, and jaw strength and paralleling some plans for his language and understanding development.



Gymnastic: We've just started a month ago, so nothing but improving his core strength more, so mostly physical exercises.



Medical (General) History - He was born by cesarean section, and the weight was 2 kg at the time of birth, not immediately crying too. He was under supervision for the next 2 days in the NICU and discharged after all other reports were okay. We didn't notice any abnormality until his first birthday while staying with parents and in joint family in our hometown during the Covid time frame. In addition, his other developmental milestones were achieved almost timely like - independent sitting at the age of 5-6 months, crawling at 9-10 months, and starting to take 1-1 steps at 12 months, and so on. Moreover, after shifting back to Pune post his first birthday and then in another 6-7 months, we've seen major changes in his behavior, like dropping his eye contact and name response during that time. Socialization was very low, and screen exposure was increased.
